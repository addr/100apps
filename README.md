# 100apps
I'm creating 100 mobile apps in 100 days. Why? Mostly for fun, but also to learn enough to bring some ideas I have to life. I think we all learn best through repetition, and committing to an app a day helps keep Parkinson's Law at bay while iterating quickly and helping me learn from my mistakes.

I'll mostly be doing Swift/iOS, maybe some React Native. With the exception of the first few, each one will be a very compressed version of - requirements, UI design, and coding.

Requirements are in the form of [user stories](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/user-stories), and UI design is simple hand drawn wireframes.

I'll be starting with iOS (Swift). Since I'm totally new to Swift, the first projects will be from [Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com), probably verbatim with a few changes thrown in for funsies. The focus of these simple projects is to get productive with Swift so I can start the 'real' projects.

I tried starting out with a 'real' project (a simple Instagram viewer that would show pictures taken by people around you), but the additional complexity of making HTTP calls, dealing with OAuth, handling responses, etc... would mean I couldn't stick to the app-a-day rule. So until I get a handle on the most fundamental Swift concepts (and I'm spending the majority of my time coding instead of Googling), I'll stick to the toy projects.
